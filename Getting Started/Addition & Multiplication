import tensorflow as tf

#Addition

Matrix_one = tf.constant([[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]])
Matrix_two = tf.constant([[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]])

first_operation = tf.add(Matrix_one, Matrix_two)
second_operation = Matrix_one + Matrix_two

with tf.Session() as session:
    result = session.run(first_operation)
    print "Defined using tensorflow function :"
    print(result)
    result = session.run(second_operation)
    print "Defined using normal expressions :"
    print(result)
    
    
Observe that both of them will give you same results.


#Multiplication :
#For multiplying tensors in tensorflow, we need to use tf.matmul()

Matrix_one = tf.constant([[2,3],[3,4]])
Matrix_two = tf.constant([[2,3],[3,4]])

first_operation = tf.matmul(Matrix_one, Matrix_two)

with tf.Session() as session:
    result = session.run(first_operation)
    print "Defined using tensorflow function :"
    print(result)
