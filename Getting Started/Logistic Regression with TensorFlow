#Logistic Regression

#Logistic Regression in TF has three parts :

1. Wieghts matrix multiplication       tf.matmul(Val, weights)
2. Biases Addition                      tf.add(weightedVals)
3. Pass results of 2 to an activation function, say sigmoid function.           tf.nn.sigmoid(weighted Vals with Biases)
